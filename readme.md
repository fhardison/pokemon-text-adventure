# pokemon-text-adventure
A Pokemon text, adventure game I'm messing around with for my kids using a modified version of https://github.com/okaybenji/text-engine

# Changes

* Added a `look around` command.
* Can add a `restriction` Boolean and a `canEnter` function to check if a player can enter a new `room`.
